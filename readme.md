my knapsack ruby solutions
==
<br/><b>unbounded:</b><br/>
after seeing a few solutions online, i decided to make a cleaner version of them on ruby. this is an unbounded solution, which means that the items are theoretically limitless (infinite). <br/>
<br/><b>0,1:</b><br/>
very similar to the previous solution. but i remove each element from the weight and values array when calling the function.
